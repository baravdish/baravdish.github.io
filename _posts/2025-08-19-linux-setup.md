title: "My favorite Linux setup"
---

So I run Linux on all my machines, both at office and work. It started when one of my projects during my PhD required development in Linux, then another, and another...and one day I decided to just get rid of Windows and move over entirely. It is always a struggle at first. But little by little you learn the tricks (read: issues) and get comfortable.

Settled with Ubuntu/Canonical after trying a lot of distros, mostly because they have shipped the good and stable kernels and graphics updates. I just want everything to work. It works. And I stick with whatever works well. To not forget the golden rule: If it works, don't touch it.

I have a private repo called *my-awesome-linux-setup*. Whenever I upgrade or get a new machine I just grab the scripts that I have stored there and run them. It is so convenient to have your setup replicated and mirrored everywhere.

Some of my favorite tools are:

- zsh
- oh my zsh (basically a UX layer of zsh, with plugins such as zsh-autosuggestions, history, git, etc.)
- tree
- vscode
- sublime-text (for note-taking - my previous IDE, now used for quick notes due to old habit)
- darktable (for viewing HDR or .exr images)
- LM-studio (a local and private LLM chat app, thinking of making a tutorial of it later on)
- Backblaze (cheap AWS, cloud bucket sync of all my data and datasets)
- blender
- zotero (for organizing papers)
- cuda (I love GPU programming)
- pip (moving over to uv soon)
- docker
- obsidian
- vlc
- htop or btop
- ulauncher

I also grab a bunch of scripts for crontab jobs to mount to my Backblaze buckets or sync to the cloud.

Yes, I've tried emacs/Vim/neovim/etc. but never liked them.
